# EducationIndex_PanelRegression
Focused on the period from 2019 to 2021, considering factors such as the year of data collection, average years of schooling, number of labs, libraries, and classrooms. A model comparison reveals that the fixed effect model of panel regression emerges good performance with an R-squared of 94.44%, an adjusted R-squared of 91.11%, and MSE of 0.2219.

### Model Comparison

Referring the Table 3.21, the fixed effect model on panel regression performs well on both the R-squared and MSE. Compared to the multiple linear regression, the fixed effect model has slightly lower R-squared and Adjusted R-squared, but it performs better on the MSE, which means the fixed model can perform better in handling the error. So, the fixed effect model is a better model than the multiple linear regression. Next, a comparison between the pooled OLS and the fixed effect model. Just the multiple linear regression, the pooled OLS has better R-squared scores but is bad at handling the error where the MSE is high, indicating large predicting residuals. In this case, the fixed effect model is a better choice, since the pooled OLS has two assumption violations. 

Next, compare the fixed effect model with the model for handling the violated assumptions. First, between the robust regression and fixed effect model. The robust model has the best performance on the R-squared scores and also performs slightly off from the fixed effect model. But the very small difference doesn’t make so much difference, so it is not so significant. The Cochran Orcutt model’s MSE has the best performance out of all models with a score of 0.2181. But, this model has the lowest R-squared score among all models. Overall, the fixed effect model performs marginally well than the Cochran-Orcutt model.

Last, comparing the fixed effect model with ridge regression. The ridge regression has better R-squared and adjusted R-squared with the score of 0.9681 and 0.9669. However, this model performs badly at the MSE, which is the highest value of MSE among all models. This high value indicates that the ridge regression is not predicting the error well. This means the fixed effect model is still better even though the ridge regression can overcome the multicollinearity problem.

Based on the overall model, the robust regression seems to give the best performance on all metrics. Since the main focus is the cross-sectional dimensions and time series, the fixed effect model of the panel regression is the better option for this problem. Moreover, the fixed effect model does an outstanding job on every metric, with an R-squared of 94.44%, an adjusted R-squared of 91.11%, and an MSE of 0.2219. By using this model, the significant variables for the index_pendidikan are only rata_rata_lama_sekolah. The other variables seem to be not affected individually but perform well while being together. This means that there are other variables such as school facilities, teachers' knowledge, and the distance between home with school may affect the index_pendidikan.
